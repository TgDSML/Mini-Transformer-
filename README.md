# 🧠 Mini-Transformer (From Scratch)

This repository contains a **minimal yet complete implementation of a Transformer encoder built from scratch in PyTorch**.  
The project is designed as a **learning-oriented, research-style implementation**, focusing on understanding and validating the **core building blocks of modern Transformer architectures** rather than relying on high-level libraries.

The implementation closely follows the original paper:  
**“Attention Is All You Need” (Vaswani et al., 2017)**

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Implement a **Transformer encoder from scratch** using PyTorch
- Gain a **deep, practical understanding** of:
  - Self-attention
  - Multi-head attention
  - Positional encodings
  - Feed-forward networks
  - Residual connections & layer normalization
- Build a **clean, modular, and testable codebase**
- Validate correctness using **unit tests**
- Serve as a **reference project** for understanding Transformer internals
